Q1 a) The Strategy Design Pattern defines behavioural procedures for an operation depending
      on the behavioural implementation used.
      
   b) This pattern is appropriate to be used when one requires different behaviours for one
      same type of interface. For instance, an Interface Duck can have operation fly to ducks 
      but a different implementation on fly for e.g.: rubber ducks

Q3 Abstract Factory is great for when is required to implement many factories under one roof.
   A top abstract class will be the roof giving shelter to all the other factories that will
   extend from this one. This will allow the caller to call upon any of the children factories.
   
Q5 Modularity expresses a range of setters and getters to allow a more specific tailored change
   on the initialised object, to avoid the construction bloat, as in adding all the required 
   fields to be given at the construction point.
