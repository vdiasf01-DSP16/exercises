8. "The Observer pattern supports the MVC pattern". 
  State if this statement is true or false and support your answer 
  by use of an appropriate example.
  
  The above statement is TRUE.
  MVC ( Method View and Controller ) is translated to the Observer pattern as
  follows:
   - View : The Observer after a message was sent from the Observable.
   - Controller : The setChanged() which will then send the update to all Observers.
   - Method : the update() method that will send from the Observable to the Observer the update.
