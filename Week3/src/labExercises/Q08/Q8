  State if this statement is true or false and support your answer 
  by use of an appropriate example.
  
  The above statement is TRUE.
  MVC ( Model View Controller ) is supported by the Observer pattern as follows:
   - View : The Observer after a message was sent from the Observable.
   - Controller : The setChanged() which will then send the update to all Observers.
   - Model : the update() method that will send from the Observable to the Observer the update.
