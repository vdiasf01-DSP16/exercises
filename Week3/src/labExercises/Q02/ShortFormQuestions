2. Are the following true or false? 

  (a) Every interface must have at least one method. 
      FALSE 
      - An interface can have no methods. e.g.: InterfaceNoMethods.java
      
  (b) An interface can declare instance fields that an implementing class 
      must also declare. 
      FALSE 
      - Interfaces can have static instance fields but does not allow to have
      private instance fields. Attempting to the latter will create a compiler error.
      e.g.: InterfaceInstanceFields.java
      
  (c) Although you can't instantiate an interface, an interface definition can 
      declare constructor methods that require an implementing class to provide 
      constructors with given signatures. Provide examples to illustrate your answers. 
      FALSE 
      - Interface cannot declare and or implement constructors. 
      e.g.: InterfaceWithConstructor.java
