 3. Provide an example of an interface with methods that do not imply responsibility on the 
    part of the implementing class to take action on behalf of the caller or to return a value. 
    

   See Main iHaveChanged() implementation from the Changed interface, which will be called by
   the Observer whenever the Observer wants. The message passed in by the Observer is then 
   printed by Main.    

   Observer and Main do not wait on each other.
