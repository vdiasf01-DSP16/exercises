4. What is the value of a stub class like WindowAdapter which is composed 
  of methods that do nothing?
  
  An Interface implementations, forces the implementation to have all methods implemented. 
  A stub implementation, overrides all methods with a minimum implementation possible
  such that when one requires to only override one method, it can use the adapter, and 
  override the needed method, knowing that all the others will be stubbed.
  
  It allows developer to write less code every time only one method of the WL is required
  to be overridden.
