9. Provide examples of two commonly used Java methods that return a new object.

  - Reflection - example MainReflection.java showing reflection instantiating a class by name.
  
  - Direct Injection - example MainBeanFactory.java,
    using Beans and Spring through the Spring.xml definitions file defining which class 
    to instantiate and with which values. Spring.xml can be extended with as many class 
    names as needed and the MainBeanFactory.java only needs to call them by the ID alias 
    given by the Spring.xml, being oblivious to what implementation will come out of it
    or with initialised values for each properties. It is with the developer to know what
    type of Object will be returned to then be casted correctly.
