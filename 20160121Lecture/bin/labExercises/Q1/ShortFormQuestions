1. Write down three differences between abstract classes and interfaces in Java 8. 
   Provide examples to illustrate your answer. 

  a) A class can extend only one abstract class 
     but it can implement multiple interfaces.
  b) - Abstract methods on abstract classes are equivalent to
       declared methods on Interfaces: 
       * both must have implementations on the extending/implementing class *
     
     - Declared methods on abstract classes are equivalent to 
       default methods on Interfaces:
       * both must be implemented within the abstract/interface *
       
  c) - Abstract classes can have internal modifiable variables.
     - Interfaces can have only static final internal variables.

  d) - Abstract classes can have defined constructors.
     - Interfaces can't.

In Summary:
  - Abstract classes are better for expanding designs when more methods 
    may be required in the future.
  - Interfaces are better when known design won't change.
  - Classes can only extend from one abstract class, but can implement from 
    multiple interfaces - great for multiple inheritance.
