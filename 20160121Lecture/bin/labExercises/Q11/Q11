11. If you want to direct output to System.out instead of to a file, 
    you can create a Writer object that directs its output to System.out:

        Writer out = new PrintWriter(System.out);

    Write a code example to define a Writer object that wraps text at 15 characters, 
    centres the text, sets the text to random casing, and directs the output to 
    System.out. Which design pattern are you using?
    
    - Decorator pattern, which will add on top of the original object the extra requirements. 
      These may not always come in the same order or even all at the same time.
    
    * Main applies the principle and executes the code.
    * MaiDecoratinWriter class extends PrintWriter and is the one driving the decoration.
    * MainDecoratingInterface class with only one method to execute the decoration

    * DecoratedWriterCenter class will centre the text into a 64 character text.
    * DecoratedWriterRandomCasing will randomly apply upper / lower cases to each text char.
    * DecoratedWriterWrap will wrap the text to 15 chars bt default or any other length supplied.
